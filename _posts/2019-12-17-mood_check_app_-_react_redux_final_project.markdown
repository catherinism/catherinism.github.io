I never actually imagined that my final project was going to be about "feelings." But a life event happened as I was getting close to my final project. My mood has been changing a lot while I deal with the side effects of chemo. Last July, I was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. I wouldn't forget that day because it was on the day I spoke with my educational coach for the last time before getting transitioned over to my career coach. 

 I am still doing treatment, but it's almost over, and I'm getting better. Yey! It took me a while to finish my project because I'm still working, and I go to 4 to 5 appointments every week. Phew!
 
 Anyway, here are some of the things I did to finish my project.
 
*  First, I created a mock-up using Adobe XD. Please take note that this is not exactly how my app looks like. I've done this with my previous projects, and it really helped me especially with the routes.

*  And since I took a break for months, I forgot most of the React lessons. Aside from the lessons in Learn.co, I reviewed React through [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact). I discovered it through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44&t=2554s).

* Then, I read some other students' blogs to check what helped them create the final project. One of them is [Sachin Majahan's](http://crackingthecode.net/final_project_react-redux_front-end_web_app_with_rails_api_back-end).

* In his blog, I learned about the [Build Rails API Backend w React Frontend](Build Rails API Backend w React Frontend) video. It really helped me start my backend and frontend, and then connect them. I don't think I've seen it in the Learn.co's video lectures.

* I watched more videos from the [Learn.co's videos](https://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/?query=React) like the Globetrotter series.
