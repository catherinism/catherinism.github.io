I never actually imagined that my final project was going to be about "feelings." But a life event happened as I was getting close to my final project. My mood has been changing a lot while I deal with the side effects of chemo. Last July, I was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. I wouldn't forget that day because it was on the day I spoke with my educational coach for the last time before getting transitioned over to my career coach. 

I am still doing treatment, but it's almost over, and I'm getting better. Yey! It took me a while to finish my project because I'm still working, and I go to 4 to 5 appointments every week. Phew!
 
 Anyway, here are some of the things I did to create my project.
 
**1. First, I designed a mock-up using Adobe XD.**

Please take note that this is not exactly how my app looks like. I've done this in my previous projects, and it helped me visualize my project and how I want my routes to work. This app was also inspired by Momentum Chrome app and some meditation apps.

**2. Reviewed React**

I took a break for months that I forgot most of the React lessons. Aside from the React lessons in Learn.co, I reviewed it through [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact), which I discovered through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44&t=2554s).
 
>  "Scrimba lets you play around with the instructor's code directly inside the screencast. As a result, you'll learn faster and have more fun.‚Äù 

**3. Read other students blogs**

Other students' blogs tremendously helped me in creating the final project. One of them is [Sachin Majahan's](http://crackingthecode.net/final_project_react-redux_front-end_web_app_with_rails_api_back-end) who happens to be my husband's cohort mate:D 


**4. Watched React/Redux videos**

It was actually in Sachin's blog that I've learned about the [Build Rails API Backend w React Frontend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRuJCeXZadM) video. It helped me start my backend and frontend, and then connect them. I don't think I've seen it in the Learn.co's video lectures.

I watched more videos from the [Learn.co's videos](https://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/?query=React) like the Globetrotter series.

**5. Added some styling**

I currently work as a graphic designer, so in every project, it isn't very easy for me not to do some styling :D As I was searching for a framework to use, I realized that there are a lot of options out there! I tried Material UI, but it was too complicated for me, so I ended up using [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). I watched some tutorials, and [Molly's (a Flatiron School alumni) blog](https://dev.to/mccarronmollye/my-first-react-project-1ijk) helped me set it up. It still took me a day to do the styling because I think I enjoyed it too much:D

*Here are some screenshots of my final project.*

My Reac/Redux project is very simple but I'm very proud of it. It took a lot of research and studies to finish, but I really enjoyed the process. But I'm glad it's done and I'm ready for the next challenge - career change!
