I never actually imagined that my final project was going to be about "feelings." But a life event happened as I was getting close to my final project. My mood has been changing a lot while I deal with the side effects of chemo. Last July, I was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. I wouldn't forget that day because it was on the day I spoke with my educational coach for the last time before getting transitioned over to my career coach.
