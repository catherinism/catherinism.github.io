For my [Sinatra project](https://github.com/catherinism/art-exhibit-sinatra-app), I decided to create an application that can help users keep track of their art exhibit opportunities. I came up with the idea because I've been wanting to exhibit to some local art galleries. However, I have other more important priorities that I keep forgetting and missing the deadlines.

This app will allow a user to create an account, add a new exhibit and see others' exhibit posts as well. Below are some of my project's screenshots.

As you can see, I put some style to it although it's not required. I was inspired by other Flatiron students' projects, particularly Razelle's [Andromeda project](https://github.com/avelineamour/andromeda-project). It was really well done!

I love design and aesthetics (I currently work as a graphic designer) so it's a bit difficult for me to submit the project without adding some style. I used Adobe XD to see how I want my app to look like and used Avocode to easily get the colors, fonts, etc. It helped me with some CSS but my free trial expired before I got to use its full potential. CSS surely took much of my time, but I learned many lessons along the way, and I'm sure it will come in handy in the future.

Aside from CSS, I also struggled in figuring out why other users can edit or delete exhibit posts that are not theirs! It took me more than an hour to figure. For those who cannot attend study groups because of work or other responsibilities, I would highly suggest you check Howard's(Sinatra Section Lead) [videos](https://github.com/howardbdev/sinatra-journal-app/blob/master/video_links.md). They are incredibly helpful! 

I truly enjoyed creating this project compare to the CLI one. I can't wait to get into Rails!
