Back in the Philippines, I studied Computer Engineering for about three years but I decided to leave school before I graduated. I got different jobs after that but I knew somehow that I was going to finish my studies no matter what. So when I got here in the US, I decided to settle my unfinished business and complete a degree in Visual Communications. I took it because I love arts, photography, and design. Anything that allows me to use my creativity interests me.

Even before finishing school (last May), however, I already spent hundreds of hours teaching myself web design using the Wordpress platform. I did this by completing both personal and professional projects. I attended meetups and even volunteered in a couple of Wordcamps in New York City. As you may have already figured out, I love coding (as much as I love arts, photography, and design) and I just keep going back to it. We have a very special bonding, and I just couldn’t let it go!

After graduation, I started to search for graphic design jobs because that was what I concentrated on when I was in school. However, I was surprised to see that most companies nowadays don’t only require design but coding skills as well. I felt like I didn’t have the edge and I know I have to do something about it. I recently got accepted to attend another SUNY school this fall semester but the thought of not having a stable job for another two or three years is killing me. So I decided to attend Flatiron School instead. 

**But why Software Development?**

* It is awesome.

* It will allow me to create.

* I want to be a part of the small percentage of women in this industry and make a difference!

* I love Sherlock Holmes and I feel like a detective trying to solve a mystery every time I get a code error!

* There is always something new to learn and I don’t feel like I am going to get stuck.

* Lastly, I want a career that is satisfying and that can support my whole family.



Thank you for reading! Till next time!:)
