After days of not being able to come up with an idea of what project to build, I reached out to some people I met at the Weekend Warrior Workshop in NYC last January. They were extremely helpful, and Ludi suggested that I check Corinna's videos on how to build a CLI Project using API because she finds it easier compared to using Scraper. She also sent links of API's I could use and they all told me to just reach out any time if I need anything. I felt so lucky!

I followed Corinna's videos and watched them a few times. Ludi was right. It looks a lot easier than scraping. Well, not totally easy, but it felt like it made me skip a few steps at the beginning of doing the project. I love Game of Thrones so I decided to use the "API of Ice and Fire". I was tempted to make it a little complicated but almost everyone said keep the project simple, and so I did.

My CLI goes like this:

When the user run the bin file, he/she will be greeted in Dothraki language and will be presented with 10 Game of Thrones Houses, and will be asked to choose a number. Once a valid input (between 1-10) is received, he/she will be presented with the details of that specific house (House, Region, and Coat of Arms). If the user enters an invalid input, he/she will receive an error message "Hodor. Hodor. Hodor." I thought that was funny! The user will be asked again to choose a number, type "list" to show the list again, or type "exit" to leave. The goodbye message I put was "Winter is coming. Goodbye." I couldn't help it!

Now, I just hope I pass the assessment.
